# DIY-smart house

this project will be comprised of a couple of parts
our smart house will be the culmination of a couple of different mini projects that will be integrated together.

this project is mostly my journey to get familiar with tools and technologies

this project will hopefully use tools like:

embedded programming (C)
algorithm (C# python ML(maybe) )
front end development (react java-script typescript html CSS)
web-server (express swagger http REST)
3D modeling (CAD, G-CODE, modeling software)
deployment (docker YAML, HELM CARTS)
database management (mongo/ postgress, persistent volumes, SQL)
hardware design (wires, I/O, low level protocols like UART, I2C, SPI)

# architecture

like most modern applications the main frontend of the application will be a functioning webapp built on react.
i currently don't know how to write in react but the main point of the front end will be to manage user interactions and to communicate with the API server.

The API server will maintain an API as defined in the SWAGGER for all front end actions

there will also be a gateway Web-server that will maintain all the communication with the edge devices

the GW Web-server will be made to be expandable to add and remove features so as to allow for a configurable edge setup (maybe it will be built in C# and the will be built using OOP design principles)

the embedded programs will be an assortment of code snippets for building the proper functionality

# get in contact

I'd love for contributions if anyone is interested
